# Aventeurier AI

## Project Description

Merchandisers at travel agencies often struggle to discover trendy and uncharted travel products. Social media platforms serve as a goldmine of travel trends and emerging destinations, offering valuable information for merchandisers. However, manually tracking social media posts is time-consuming and inefficient due to their transient nature and lack of structured data, leading to missed opportunities and outdated travel offerings.

Our project aims to streamline merchandisers' work by developing an AGI that automates market research and product development based on social media. Users can query their intended travel offerings, and our system will return results along with the corresponding source (i.e. Instagram posts). If a user requests a travel plan, it displays the results on a map, highlighting the most optimal route. We build a RAG system with Solar LLM to ground the AI's responses on Instagram posts containing valuable, trending travel information. Additionally, we integrate Google Maps API to generate travel plans with optimal routes.

Our system helps merchandisers easily discover trending travel products from social media, enabling them to create a satisfying travel experience for various customer segments. While traditional travel products at agencies often cater to older age groups, our service is designed to meet the travel needs of the younger generation by combining the power of AGI and social media. This innovative approach will help the industry stay ahead of trends and better serve all demographics.
